# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to assist Maria and her supervisor of the overall performance of the students within Thomas High School. Maria and her supervisor were informed by the school board that the children within this school were not performing to their highest potential (more specifically, 9th graders with their reading and math scores). Maria wishes for us to outline the data within the statistics worksheet she's given us to show a clearer picture to the school board and to acknowlege any "unavailable" scores as needed.

## Results

### The following are the details results from the School Analysis for the original and challenge data set:

- How is the district summary affected (original data set)?

  - The passing math score within the original data set is 75
  - The passing reading score within the original data set is 86
